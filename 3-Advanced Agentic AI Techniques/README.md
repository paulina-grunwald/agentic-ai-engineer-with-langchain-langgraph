#  Advanced Agentic AI Techniques
This course equips learners with the essential skills and knowledge to design and implement sophisticated agent-based systems. The course covers long-term memory integration within agents, emphasizing the
LangGraph framework. Participants explore multi-agent architectures and state management, focusing on effective orchestration and data routing. Through hands-on projects, learners will implement agentic systems, culminating in the development of an Autonomous Knowledge Agent
