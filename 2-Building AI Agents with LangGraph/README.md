This course guides learners through the essentials of implementing intelligent agents using LangGraph. Learners will explore external tools and APIs, and learn how to integrate them effectively within their agents. Key lessons include interacting with databases and implementing LangGraph Database Agents for efficient data retrieval. The course covers advanced topics like Retrieval Augmented Generation, incorporating human-in-the-loop strategies, and ensuring agent observability and reliability. Finally, learners will apply these concepts in a hands-on project, designing an Energy Advisor agent, which synthesizes their knowledge into a practical application.
