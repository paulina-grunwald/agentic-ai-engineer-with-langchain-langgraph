# Agentic AI Engineer with LangChain and LangGraph Nanodegree

Agentic AI Engineer with LangChain and LangGraph is a program that teaches Python developers how to turn large‑language‑model applications into fully autonomous agents.  You begin with LangChain fundamentals—prompt templates, chains, memory, and single‑tool agents—then progress to multi‑tool planning, self‑critique loops, and deployment practices. Finally, you integrate external knowledge through retrieval‑augmented generation, long‑term memory, and multi‑agent collaboration.

Course chapters:
1. Advanced Agentic AI Techniques
2. Building AI Agents with LangGraph
3. Advanced Agentic AI Techniques
